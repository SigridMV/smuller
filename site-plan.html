      <p>
        Skills <br>HTML, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the code used to
        structure and display a web page and its contents. <br>CSS, is the language
        for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout,
        and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of
        devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is
        independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
        <br>SASS essentials, is a CSS preprocessor, a superset of CSS that adds
        features that aren't available in regular CSS. <br>JavaScript, is a
        lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language
        with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting
        language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such
        as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. <br>React basic, is a free and
        open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
        based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
        community of individual developers and companies. <br>Angular basic, is a
        platform and framework for building single-page client applications
        using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It
        implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript
        libraries that you import into your applications. <br>Vue.js basic, is an
        open source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive
        web interfaces. It is one of the famous frameworks used to simplify web
        development. VueJS focusses on the view layer. It can be easily
        integrated into big projects for front-end development without any
        issues. <br>Java, is a widely used object-oriented programming language and
        software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook
        computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many
        others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++
        languages.<br> Python, is a computer programming language often used to
        build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.
        Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a
        variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific
        problems. <br>SQL, is a standardized programming language that is used to
        manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data
        in them. <br>Scrum, is a management framework that teams use to
        self-organize and work towards a common goal. It describes a set of
        meetings, tools, and roles for efficient project delivery. Much like a
        sports team practicing for a big match, Scrum practices allow teams to
        self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change. <br>Frontend and
